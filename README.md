# Cryptocurrencies

**Background:**
To create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for new investment.

The data will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models; specifically unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, clustering algorithm will be utilized and data visualizations to share findings.

**Lists of four technical analysis parts will be the deliverables:**
Part 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
Part 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
Part 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
Part 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
